# Decentralized Application With Substrate 
In This section we will create your own FRAME pallet to include in your custom blockchain. The Substrate Developer Hub Node Template comes with a template pallet that we will use as a starting point to build our own custom runtime logic.


### First clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PankajChaudhary5/Decentralized-Application-With-Substrate.git

### Compile your node
cargo build --release

### Launch your chain in dev mode
./target/release/node-template --dev --tmp

### Now you can open the Polkadot.js UI to test the code
